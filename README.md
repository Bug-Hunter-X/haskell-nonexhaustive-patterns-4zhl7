This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: non-exhaustive patterns in function definitions. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, which fails to handle all possible input cases.  The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version with exhaustive pattern matching.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering all possible input scenarios when defining functions using pattern matching in Haskell.
